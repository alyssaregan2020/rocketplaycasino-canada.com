                        <h2 class="h3 mt-5">1. Our Commitment to a Safe Gaming Environment</h2>
                        <p>At <span class="accent-keyword">Rocket Play Casino</span> , we are dedicated to providing a thrilling and enjoyable entertainment experience. Central to this mission is our profound commitment to responsible gambling. We recognize that while most players enjoy our games as a form of leisure, for a small number, it can become a problem.</p>
                        <p>Our objective is to create a safe, transparent, and responsible framework that empowers you to manage your play effectively. We have developed a suite of policies and tools to promote responsible gaming and offer support to those who may need it. Your well-being is our top priority, and we want to ensure your experience with us remains positive and controlled.</p>

                        <h2 class="h3 mt-5">2. Player Protection Tools: You Are in Control</h2>
                        <p>We strongly encourage all players to utilize our suite of responsible gaming tools. These features are designed to help you manage your time and budget, ensuring your gambling remains a fun and affordable form of entertainment. You can access and configure these tools directly within your account settings after using your <span class="accent-keyword">Rocket Play casino login</span> .</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Deposit Limits:</h3>
                        <p>Set a cap on the amount of money you can deposit into your account on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Once this limit is reached, you will be unable to make further deposits until the period resets, helping you stay within your budget.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Loss Limits:</h3>
                        <p>Control the maximum net amount you are willing to lose over a set period (daily, weekly, or monthly). Our system will prevent you from placing further wagers once this limit is reached, which is a key strategy to avoid chasing losses.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Wager Limits:</h3>
                        <p>Manage the total amount of money you can bet over a specific timeframe. This tool helps you control your overall volume of play, providing another layer of financial management.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Session Limits (Reality Check):</h3>
                        <p>Keep track of your time on our platform by setting a session time limit. A pop-up notification will appear when the time is up, giving you a clear reminder and the option to log out.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Cool-Off Period:</h3>
                        <p>If you feel the need to take a short break from gaming, you can activate a Cool-Off Period for a duration ranging from 24 hours to 6 weeks. During this time, your account will be temporarily suspended, and you will be excluded from all marketing communications.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Self-Exclusion:</h3>
                        <p>For players who feel they are losing control and need a longer, more definitive break, Self-Exclusion is a critical tool. By activating self-exclusion, you are choosing to block access to your account for a minimum of 6 months, up to several years, or even permanently.</p>
                        <p>During the self-exclusion period:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your <span class="accent-keyword">Rocket Play casino login</span> will be disabled.</li>
                            <li>You will be unable to access your account via the website or the <span class="accent-keyword">rocket play casino app</span> .</li>
                            <li>We will take all reasonable measures to prevent you from opening new accounts.</li>
                            <li>You will be removed from all marketing lists.</li>
                            <li>Any remaining real money balance in your account will be returned to you.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="h3 mt-5">3. Recognizing a Potential Problem</h2>
                        <p>Responsible gambling is about awareness. If you are concerned about your gambling habits, please consider the following questions honestly:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do you spend more money or time gambling than you originally intended?</li>
                            <li>Have you ever hidden the extent of your gambling from people you care about?</li>
                            <li>Are you trying to win back money you have lost by gambling more?</li>
                            <li>Has gambling caused problems in your personal relationships, work, or studies?</li>
                            <li>Do you gamble to escape from stress, boredom, or other problems?</li>
                            <li>Have you ever borrowed money or sold anything to get money to gamble?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If you answered "yes" to one or more of these questions, it may indicate a gambling problem. We urge you to speak to someone and to use our self-exclusion tool immediately.</p>

                        <h2 class="h3 mt-5">4. Where to Find Professional Help</h2>
                        <p>Recognizing you may need help is the most important step. Several independent organizations provide free, confidential, and professional support for anyone affected by problem gambling. We highly recommend contacting them:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Gamblers Anonymous:</strong> A global fellowship providing peer support for individuals with a gambling problem.<br>Website: www.gamblersanonymous.org</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="h3 mt-5">5. Preventing Underage Gambling</h2>
                        <p>It is strictly illegal for anyone under the age of 18 (or the legal age of majority in their jurisdiction) to open an account or gamble on our platform. We take this responsibility very seriously.</p>
                        <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Age Verification:</h3>
                        <p>We perform mandatory identity and age verification (KYC) checks on all customers. Accounts that cannot be verified will be suspended.</p>
                        <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Parental Controls:</h3>
                        <p>We advise parents to use filtering software (such as Net Nanny™ or CyberPatrol) to prevent minors from accessing online gambling content. Parents who share devices should be particularly mindful of installed applications, such as the <span class="accent-keyword">rocket play casino app apk</span> file on Android devices.</p>
